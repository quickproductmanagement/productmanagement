# Product Management
Product Management is straightforward but made to sound complicated. Product management is nothing new. It is probably a new concept in the some business space but not in manufacturing for example. Let's think of the refrigerator or the washing machine for example. Product management was required for the get these products to market.

You may have seen many articles or videos that compare Project management versus Product management. Yet again, there is no need to dwell on making such comparisons as they are different subject matters.

Product management draws from a number of disciplines; finance, economics, marketing, strategy, operations, organisational behaviour, innovation, science & technology, oursourcing, law amongst others. It does not mean that the product manager needs to be an expert in all these disciplines. The product manager should however have an idea about these areas and work with people who are experts in these functions.

Simply put the product manager will lead the creation, enhancement or support of a product by working with many people in many functions in a business.
